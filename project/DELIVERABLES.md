# MTL-XF-024 — Required deliverables and metric contracts

**Decision:** Which geographic, age and apprenticeship-level segments warrant employer-engagement or participation-support investigation based on starts, participation and achievement patterns?  
**Business acceptance:** Director of Skills & Employment  
**Core scope:** Use the agreed geography CSV. Completed-year trend baseline is 2020/21–2024/25; display 2025/26 August–April provisional figures separately. No year-on-year comparison with 2025/26 is permitted unless the same August–April window is available and verified. Use the publisher's per-100,000 population unit and available age/level/geography combinations.

All artefact locations refer to the team repository. Deliver the core before optional extensions. [The source register](../data/SOURCE_REGISTER.md) documents evidence status; required field support is a G1 release condition.

## D1 — Discovery & requirements

**Due:** Week 1 · **Location:** `docs/01-discovery/` · **Owner:** Business Analyst

Map the quarterly skills participation and employer-engagement review, stakeholder needs, current reporting failures and target decision. Eight prioritised requirements must cover the business questions, scope gates and usable outputs.

**Pass evidence:** Each requirement has an accountable user, artefact, test and acceptance owner.

## D2 — Sources, governance & cohort contract

**Due:** Week 2 · **Location:** `data/; docs/02-data-governance/` · **Owner:** Data Governance Analyst

Complete the source-to-deliverable support matrix and classify core, fallback and optional inputs. Use the agreed geography CSV. Completed-year trend baseline is 2020/21–2024/25; display 2025/26 August–April provisional figures separately. No year-on-year comparison with 2025/26 is permitted unless the same August–April window is available and verified. Use the publisher's per-100,000 population unit and available age/level/geography combinations.

**Pass evidence:** Every used input has provenance, exact version/coverage, licence evidence and SHA-256; conditional scope cannot be signed off without supporting fields.

## D3 — Reproducible model & ingestion

**Due:** Week 3 · **Location:** `src/; sql/; docs/03-data-model/` · **Owner:** Data Engineer

Implement raw preservation, selection, schema checks, curated facts and dimensions. Reporting year × coverage window × geography level/code × available age band × apprenticeship level × other published breakdowns. Population and learner measures may have different valid denominator coverage.

**Pass evidence:** Zero unexplained duplicate keys or join inflation; every input row accounted for as retained/excluded/quarantined.

## D4 — Quality, source reconciliation & exceptions

**Due:** Week 3 · **Location:** `tests/; docs/04-data-quality/` · **Owner:** Independent reviewer + domain specialist

Execute source, denominator, missingness, boundary and linkage checks against the risk 'Partial-year comparisons and same-period achievement ratios can create false claims about weakening learner completion.'

**Pass evidence:** Reconcile five source values from at least two periods or segments; retain source coordinates, precision and explanations for non-additive totals.

## D5 — Governed metric catalogue

**Due:** Week 4 · **Location:** `docs/05-kpi-catalogue/` · **Owner:** Domain specialist + Data Governance Analyst

Implement the 8 metric contracts below; distinguish unconditional core metrics from gated extensions.

**Pass evidence:** Each core metric has purpose, raw fields, formula, grain, denominator/unit, missing/zero handling, owner, refresh and test; conditional items have explicit eligibility or unavailable status.

## D6 — Domain assessment

**Due:** Week 5 · **Location:** `analysis/; docs/06-analysis/` · **Owner:** Domain analyst

Produce a starts/participation/achievements trend for comparable windows, with age/level/geography views only where present. Identify up to ten weakening skills segments and separate declining volume from population-adjusted participation.

**Pass evidence:** At least five supported findings answer the five questions or document a genuine evidence gap; each includes magnitude, scope, comparison and limitation.

## D7 — Investigation framework & scenarios

**Due:** Week 6 · **Location:** `docs/07-decision-framework/` · **Owner:** Director of Skills & Employment (business acceptance)

Compare weakening completed-year segments ordered by absolute starts/participation decline and by compatible population-adjusted participation decline. Keep 2025/26 partial-year signals in a separate provisional watchlist. Use identical eligibility criteria for the compared scenarios; no completion-risk score.

**Pass evidence:** Publish eligibility, component definitions, scenario differences and up to ten supported cases; every case names a service role, evidence request and review trigger.

## D8 — Decision-support BI

**Due:** Draft Week 6; final Week 7 · **Location:** `dashboard/` · **Owner:** BI Developer

Build overview, diagnostic and quality pages for the quarterly skills participation and employer-engagement review. Show period, units, definitions, missingness and core/extension status.

**Pass evidence:** Five headline values reconcile; every visible filter and reset tested; accessible static export plus free review/build path.

## D9 — Assurance & simulated UAT

**Due:** Week 7 · **Location:** `docs/08-assurance-uat/` · **Owner:** Independent reviewer

Execute DT1–DT10 below, plus any tool-specific calculations and filter tests. Record expected/actual evidence, requirement links and defects.

**Pass evidence:** All ten mandatory domain cases evidenced; no critical/high issue remains; accepted lower-impact limitations have named review.

## D10 — Technical & operational handover

**Due:** Week 8 · **Location:** `docs/09-technical-handover/` · **Owner:** Data Engineer + a second-member reviewer

Provide environment, immutable manifest, end-to-end run, output checks, troubleshooting and refresh/change process.

**Pass evidence:** A second member regenerates equivalent core outputs without undocumented edits and records checks, environment, duration and result.

## D11 — Executive briefing & presentation

**Due:** Week 8 · **Location:** `deliverables/` · **Owner:** Business Analyst + specialist service roles

Deliver maximum two-page briefing and 15–20 minute presentation to Director of Skills & Employment: decision, five findings, scenario comparison, investigation actions, evidence gaps and next review.

**Pass evidence:** Every numeric claim links to tested evidence; explicitly show a case where action is not yet supported.

## D12 — Contribution & delivery record

**Due:** Weekly; final Week 8 · **Location:** `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` · **Owner:** Delivery Lead

Link actual authored work, reviews, issues/PRs/commits and presentation/handover contributions for every member.

**Pass evidence:** All responsibilities have owners and evidence; commit count alone is insufficient.

## Metric contracts — authoritative definitions

| Metric | Definition / support condition |
| --- | --- |
| Starts | Published apprenticeship starts for the exact period and segment. |
| Participation | Published participation measure; retain publisher definition of persons/episodes and period. |
| Achievements | Published achievements for the exact period and segment. |
| Comparable starts change | Current starts minus previous matching-window starts, plus percentage change where base > 0. |
| Population participation rate | Use published participation_rate_per_100000_population; if independently computed, 100,000 × participation / compatible population_estimate, with documented rounding and age conventions. |
| Achievement-to-starts activity ratio | Achievements / starts in the same period; label as an unlinked activity ratio, never a completion probability. |
| Segment share | 100 × segment starts / compatible parent starts, excluding overlapping categories. |
| Coverage | Valid non-suppressed segment-period cells / expected selected cells. |

For each metric add source ID and actual raw fields, business purpose, formula, grain, valid population, unit, numerator/denominator, hierarchy, suppression/zero/missing handling, owner, refresh and test evidence. Verify source rounding before setting a reconciliation tolerance. A conditional item is not silently promoted into core; a core requirement is not silently waived.

## Project-specific outcomes

1. No core trend compares August–April provisional activity with August–July full-year activity.
2. Every population rate uses per 100,000 and retains source age-reference limitations.
3. Every segment action distinguishes participation support from a request for linked progression evidence.

See [DT1–DT10 and investigation rules](ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA.md) for worked pass/fail cases. Source schemas, specific period selections and reference versions must be signed at G1. Keep calculation definitions here; other guidance pages link to this contract rather than maintaining competing copies.
